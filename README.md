# WhatDoesFoxSay

This program will read from the file "Audio.txt" in the format of int, lines of audio sounds, sound definitions in the form "<animal> goes <sound>". It will take the information and print out the remaining sounds. 
You can input multiple entries in the same format. There cannot be a gap line between entries. Input your audio files by entering them into "Audio.txt". Follow the examples. 
End each audio entry with "what does the fox say?" to initiate sorting process. The results print out in the terminal.  

## Outside sources
While writing I only drew code from one website.
This code allowed me to split the strings of sounds and sound definitions into my arrays, giving each string a chronological slot in both arrays.

## Folder Structure

Necessary pieces to the code reside in the 'src' folder. FoxTalks.java is the main code file. Audio.txt is the input file.
